## Project thoughts
I am interested in data related to China's anti-sanctions. On June 1, 2021, China implemented the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law and began to anti-sanction foreign entities in response to foreign sanctions. But what caused China to respond or not to respond? What is the pattern of China's anti-sanctions enforcement? I will use my own collected data to explain these questions.
